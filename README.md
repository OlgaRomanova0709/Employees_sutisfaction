# Employees sutisfaction

* We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

## Questions to uncover:

**1)Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?**

**2)Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?**

In this guided project, we experienced that in order to extract any meaningful insights from our data, we had to perform many data cleaning tasks. In order to create one visualization (and not even the final one), we completed the following tasks:

* Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis
* Corrected some of the missing values
* Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
* Renamed our columns
* Verified the quality of our data
* Created a new institute_service column
* Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
* Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
* Combined the data
* Cleaned the institute_service column
* Handled the missing values in the dissatisfied column
* Aggregated the data
